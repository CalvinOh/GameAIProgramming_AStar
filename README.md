# GameAIProgramming_AStar

This is a simple program for a Game AI class. For the class we needed to create a program where an agent could move from a start point to an end point on a map with obstacles. 

We had to try doing it ourselves first and then do it again using the AStar method. 

This program was coded by Calvin Oh and Jiening Tao
